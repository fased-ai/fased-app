# OpenAI development connection

This build accepts **disposable `fased-test-` keys only**, never real OpenAI credentials. Normal and managed cores cannot execute provider calls. A standalone `serve --ai-fixture` core can authenticate a bound test connection to its compiled in-process fixture. Tests inject a trusted loopback HTTPS Responses endpoint; no endpoint/CA override, real model call, subscription, wallet or public-update authority is exposed in the application.

In Agents → Settings, save a test key with a separate vault passphrase of at least 12 characters. The form clears both fields on submission. The core returns only a random connection reference, model/capability information and lock state. In Chat or Scheduled AI steps, select this connection, prepare the complete disclosure and approve its exact digest/limits. Changing the saved provider preference does not change a connection or approve execution.

The existing private core owns `ai-credentials.json`: Argon2id (64 MiB, three iterations, parallelism two) derives an AES-256-GCM key from the vault passphrase and a random salt. Authentication binds the encrypted API key to the instance and random connection reference. The private data directory/file protections apply (0700/0600 on Unix, current-user/SYSTEM DACL on Windows). No unlock password or encryption master key is stored next to the ciphertext. The unlocked credential stays in core memory for at most 15 minutes, and lock, logout, restart or ciphertext changes invalidate it. These controls protect stored data; a compromised owner account/core can access an unlocked credential. Go/browser memory cannot promise perfect zeroization.

Replacement requires the current reference and vault passphrase and creates a fresh reference. Prepared/queued old references cannot dispatch, and active requests are cancelled on revocation/lock. Unknown dispatched usage retains its reservation and is never retried. Completed answers and journals survive replacement/removal. Removal requires the vault passphrase, preserves request history/holds and is local deletion, not provider-side revocation or secure disk erasure.

The encrypted vault is separate from SQLite and deliberately excluded from metadata snapshots/backups. Metadata recovery cannot unlock or recreate a credential; missing/changed vault references fail closed. Back up the encrypted file separately if desired and keep its passphrase separately. Losing the passphrase requires provider-side revocation and reconnection; app-password recovery cannot decrypt it. Preserve a damaged vault before owner recovery. This fixture path does not claim an OS keychain or unattended background unlock.

The advanced CLI shares the same owner-authenticated private IPC:

```sh
fased-app ai-connection --data-dir /private/instance
fased-app ai-connection --data-dir /private/instance --request-stdin
```

`--request-stdin` requires a private pipe (an echoing terminal is refused). Send one strict JSON object: action `save` with `key`, `passphrase` and current `ref` (empty on first save); `unlock` or `remove` with `ref`/`passphrase`; `lock` with `ref` and no secrets. Never put keys/passphrases in command arguments, shell history or shared files. Responses never return secrets. Generic `agents` commands accept `connectionRef`, never credentials; both manual and scheduled consent bind it.

The Responses contract uses fixed instructions, scoped data, `store:false`, no tools, a strict answer/draft schema and explicit input/output/deadline/example-cost limits. Controlled HTTPS fixtures verify Bearer authentication, certificate validation, exact origin/path, redirect refusal, no environment proxy, no retries and usage reconciliation. Credential reflections/errors never enter history. Model `fixture-openai-v1` and rates 1/4 micro USD per input/output token are **fixture capabilities**, not an OpenAI model/tokenizer/tariff guarantee. Production model/access/pricing evaluation and live activation remain separate gates.

The wire contract follows the official [Responses API](https://developers.openai.com/api/reference/resources/responses/methods/create), [Structured Outputs](https://developers.openai.com/api/docs/guides/structured-outputs) and [API key guidance](https://developers.openai.com/api/docs/guides/production-best-practices#api-keys). No SDK/service dependency was added. Schema 7 plus `agents-ai-connections-v1` protects binding fields from older writers; a paused schema-6 instance must finish recovery before migration. Existing unbound fixture plans/requests remain records, but changed request digests require fresh manual consent before a new dispatch.
